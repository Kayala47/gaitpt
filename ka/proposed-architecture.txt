Goals: Use inverse kinematics to animate the joint positions of two-hipped animals
and then return lists of positions for each joint when walking from start to goal. 

Requirements:
- will be able to pass in gaits as described in: 
https://www.animatornotebook.com/learn/quadrupeds-gaits
- can accomodate different numbers of legs, although we'll assume two hips for now
- will need to be animated at some point

Classes Needed:
- HingedSegment: as implemented in prof Clark's code. will represent parts of a leg 
- Leg: combines functionality of original Leg and Segment Chain
- Hip: is assigned some number of legs, controls their synchronization (for applying gaits)
- Animat: combines hip and leg classes, in charge of animation and propagation of gaits
- Gait: special data type, contains info about how each leg moves:
    - start with two legs, think about how to expand to have more legs. 
- Pt: for defining points
